  ## Description
  This Homework assignment was completed for Unit Eighteen of the U of M Bootcamp, to build a backend api for handling and storing data for a simple social media website (front-end with PWA coming soon???). We can:
  * create, update, lookup, or delete users
  * add to or remove from users' friends lists
  * create, update, lookup, or delete thoughts (posts)
  * add or remove reactions to thoughts

  ## Installation
  This project requires [Mongo installation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/) to run.

  To install this project after copying down the repo, you will first need to run npm install on the project root, which should grant you access to the necessary packages.

  ## Usage
  1. Open a terminal on the project root and run nodemon index.js.
  2. In Postman, import the included postman.json file found in the project root.
  3. In Postman, hit the routes using the included url params and body requests.

  ## Contributing
  If you want to contribute to this project - particularly if you know how I might enhance it to include live chats or seeing if your friends are online, see my contact info in the Questions section below. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out! I am a beginner at this stuff but always hungry to learn from others in the community.

  ## Tests
  This app is best tested using nodemon and postman for just the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE API calls. There is no front-end for us to run it on yet.
